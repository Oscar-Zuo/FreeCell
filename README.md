How to play the game

Freecell follows a basic solitaire format, with players aiming to create four winning foundation piles – one for each card suit. As with all solitaire games, cards can be stacked in the tableau based on color and value. For example, a red four stacks on a black five, which stacks on a red six. And so on.
As and when players expose ace cards, they can move them to the foundation piles. They can then move any following cards to the foundation piles chronologically based on their value.
Players can also make use of four ‘free cells’ above the tableau – where cards can be stored to free up more useful cards stacked below.
The game is won when the player completes the four foundation piles.
